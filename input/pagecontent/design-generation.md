Explore the generation of an AU Patient Summary document from existing My Health Record (MHR) data using FHIR Named Queries.

•	Assumes that clinical data already exists in MHR (e.g., from CDA documents). No data upload is required by participants.
•	Participants will:
o	Use FHIR Named Queries to retrieve and assemble data into a FHIR Document Bundle representing the Patient Summary.
o	Evaluate the use of Named Queries as a generic abstraction layer over complex repository structures.

Rationale: This option focuses on data discovery and document generation, offering a lightweight but meaningful interaction with SHIP concepts without explicitly mentioning SHIP. It is well-suited for testing the feasibility and utility of Named Queries in simplifying access to federated health data.
