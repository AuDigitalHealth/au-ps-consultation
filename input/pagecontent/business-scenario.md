### Overview

This Implementation Guide is built around a modified version of the [Interstate GP Visit Use Case](https://build.fhir.org/ig/hl7au/au-fhir-ps/uc-interstate.html). The scenario has been adapted to reflect the role of MHR in the Australian healthcare ecosystem, with additional emphasis on capturing the patient's story, goals, cultural identity, and values.

#### Scenario Overview

**Phase 1: Patient Summary Generation and Curation**

Before departing for a holiday in Queensland, Mia—a Sydney resident—proactively logs into her My Health Record to prepare for potential healthcare needs while travelling. She initiates the generation of a Patient Summary document, which compiles clinical content from documents previously submitted by her healthcare providers across various care settings.

Mia then takes an active role in personalising this summary by adding meaningful annotations and contributing her own narrative. This patient-authored content includes her current health goals, cultural background, personal healthcare story, and any preferences or concerns she wants future healthcare providers to understand. Once satisfied with the enriched content, she stores this annotated Patient Summary document securely within her My Health Record.

**Phase 2: Clinical Access and Care Delivery**

During her holiday in North Queensland, Mia unexpectedly experiences a health issue and seeks care from a local GP who is unfamiliar with her medical history. The GP efficiently accesses Mia's My Health Record and retrieves her previously prepared Patient Summary document.

This comprehensive summary provides the GP with immediate access to essential structured clinical data—including current medications, known allergies, recent immunisations, and relevant medical history. Equally valuable is Mia's patient-curated narrative, which offers crucial insights into her personal healthcare preferences, cultural considerations, individual values, and specific health goals.

Armed with both clinical facts and personal context, the GP can deliver care that is not only medically appropriate but also respectful of Mia's individual circumstances, culturally sensitive, and aligned with her personal healthcare values and preferences.

**Outcome**

This enriched, patient-enhanced summary enables more effective and truly person-centred care delivery, particularly valuable in unplanned care scenarios where the patient is unfamiliar to the provider and traditional continuity of care mechanisms are unavailable.
